Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) populations are being driven into decline and will soon be protected under the Endangered Species Act. Critical to the persistence of this species of cultural and ecological importance is milkweed (Asclepias spp.), which monarchs rely on as an essential resource. Motivated by concerns over the loss of monarch habitat, the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden (SBBG) and local collaborators are working to restore milkweed habitat and identify potential restoration areas in the Los Padres National Forest (LPNF). The capstone team identified high-priority survey sites within the LPNF by predicting the habitat suitability for four early-season milkweed species using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution modeling and creating a novel survey site accessibility index. These priority maps will help guide SBBG field survey efforts to monitor milkweed populations for restoration efforts within the LPNF. To communicate these results as a tool for field planning, the capstone team created an interactive web dashboard containing all of the project components.

### To achieve this goal we have utilized the following repositories
1.  [milkweed-mod](https://github.com/milkweed-mod/milkweed-mod)
   
Identify high-priority milkweed survey sites, based on habitat suitability and physical accessibility, throughout the Los Padres National Forest to direct Santa Barbara Botanic Garden summer 2024 field surveys.

2. [milkweed-site-finder](https://github.com/milkweed-mod/milkweed-site-finder)
   
Deliver all components of objective 1 in the form of an interactive web dashboard to facilitate field survey planning and allow for future updates as additional data is collected.
